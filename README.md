# Bash Script Assignments

This project contains two Bash scripts that help check directories and count files.

## Scripts

### alt-bashscript-1.sh
- Checks if a directory exists.
- Counts files inside that directory.

**How to use:**
```bash
./alt-bashscript-1.sh <directory_path>
### alt-bashscript-2.sh
This script also checks if a directory exists and counts the number of files inside it.

It does the same job as `alt-bashscript-1.sh` but may use a different method or code style.

**How to use:**
```bash
./alt-bashscript-2.sh <directory_path>
